# record-search

First of all thank you for even checking this out. I am not usually writing LUA things but I have been wanting to do this for a while and finally decided to do so.

# Notes
I made this for myself so it is setup to support my setup. I keep everything under the same database so that's why I can use oxmysql to check the database for my records.
I may make edits in the future if the desire is wanted. I have given a simple line in the server.lua to easily change the export. This will save you a good minute lol.

# The UI is trash
Well again I made this for myself so I wasn't making it look pretty. I may come back in the future to tighty it up and make it look better. I may even bring in some extra stuff but let me know if that's something you're interested in.

# Can I make edits
Yes you can fork the repo and make commits if you'd like to help. I do appreciate it however please do not use this resource to A: make a paid resource or B: re-release

# Some setup stuff
Drag and drop in your resource folder and type `ensure record-search`

# Instructions on how to use it
record-search has both text-chat commands and an mdt you may use either one however the text command is `/recordsearch` while the mdt is `/mdt`

Please enjoy the resource and let me know what I can do to make it better!
